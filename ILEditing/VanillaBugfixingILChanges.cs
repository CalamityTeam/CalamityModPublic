        // head segments from the same original worm. TML allows us to safely handle this with its drop hooks. Unfortunately, however, this does not apply to banner dropping logic based on total kills or
        // for bestiary registrations.
        // As such, we must IL Edit the vanilla drop method to stop it from registering kills based on worms that can still be split. This references the same blocking logic as the aforementioned hooks.
